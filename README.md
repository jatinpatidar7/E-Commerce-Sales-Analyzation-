# Summary
In this Python-based E-commerce analysis project, I started by cleaning and understanding the dataset using functions like
head(), info(), and describe() to check data structure, data types, and summary statistics. The Order Date and Ship Date
columns were converted from object type to datetime format to enable accurate time-based analysis.
From the Order Date, I extracted new features such as Month, Year, and Day of Week, which helped in identifying sales and
profit trends over time. After data preparation, I performed data visualization using Python libraries to analyze sales and
profit patterns across different time periods, categories, and sub-categories.
The visual insights clearly highlighted seasonal trends, top-performing categories, and profitable sub-categories, helping in
better business decision-making related to sales planning, inventory management, and profit optimization.
